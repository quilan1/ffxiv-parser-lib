# FFXIV Parser Lib

This is purely a proof-of-concept project I made for myself, despite the other libraries that enable one to read the tables & data from the FFXIV packed data files.

In the mean time, I just wanted a fun project to parse the files myself & understand the structure myself, as there were a number of aspects of the file format that were undocumented (from what I could see).

A writeup of the process to, e.g. read from the `item` table may be found in [this](sqpack.md) document.
